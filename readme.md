#A Graph A Day

This is a Twitter bot, which can tweet pictures of random graphs.
It also listens for mentions and answers them with pictures of graphs
it detects in the tweet. The layout ans styles are also extracted from the
tweet if possible. If a number smaller than 1025 is detected, it is used as
the number of nodes.

##Setup

Install all dependencies, start Cytoscape as `cytoscape -R 1234`.
Every time the program runs it will create a graph, save it as `png` and `svg`
and its details in a `txt` named after the current unix timestamp and tweets
it. Do not forget to put in valid keys and secrets in `keys_and_secrets.py`.
