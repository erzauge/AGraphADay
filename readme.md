# A Graph A Day

This is a Twitter bot, which can tweet pictures of random graphs.
It also listens for mentions and answers them with pictures of graphs
it detects in the tweet. The layout ans styles are also extracted from the
tweet if possible. If a number smaller than 1025 is detected, it is used as
the number of nodes.

## Selection of Recognized Keywords

### Graph Types

    * Watts-Strogatz
    * Barab√°si-Albert
    * Powerlaw cluster graph
    * Delaunay triangulation and some subgraphs
    * Minimum Radius graph
    * some real world networks (source: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/)
    * Caveman graph

### Styles

    * Betweenness
        * dark background
        * node color and size dependent on betweenness centrality
        * edge thickness dependent on betweenness centrality

    * Degree
        * white background
        * node size and color dependent on their degree

### Layouts

    * sfdp
    * Fruchterman Reingold (spring based layout)
    * ARF (attractive and repulsive forces, nodes inside a disk)
    * radial tree
    * blockmodel (stochastic blockmodel based hirachic layout)
    * dot (from graphviz, a hierarchic layout)
    * neato (from graphviz also known as Kamada-Kawai)
    * circular (nodes on a circle)

## Setup

Every time the program runs it will create a graph, save it as `png`
and its details in a `txt` named after the current unix timestamp and tweets
it.

**Important:** Do not forget to put in valid keys and secrets in `keys_and_secrets.py`.

Also there is at least one submodule which should be loaded from GitHub,
therefore run `git submodule update --init --recursive` after cloning.

## Dependencies

    * from PyPI
        * networkx
        * matplotlib
        * scipy
        * python-pygraphviz
        * tweepy
        * fuzzywuzzy
        * graph-tool

    * Imagemagick
    * optipng
