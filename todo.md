# TODO

    * clustering algorithms to color the nodes
    * do something sensible with bipartite graphs (special layouts)
    * SQLAlchemy/SQLite db to store data (instead of textfiles)
    * introduce some kind of rate limiting against DOS attacks
    * generate social network on request (graph of followers on twitter)
